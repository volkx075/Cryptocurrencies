# Cryptocurrencies
**Code:** ![Crypto Clustering](crypto_clustering.ipynb)
## Purpose
Our goal is to help Martha, a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting. The investment bank, Accountability Accounting, would like us to generate a report of cryptocurrencies on the trading market and how we can classify them. We will use unsupervised learning and group the data using a clustering algorithm. Also, we will create visuals to share our findings with Accountability Accounting.
